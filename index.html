            was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be
            one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is known for
            developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important
            contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.

              >Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of
              modern physics.</b
            >
            His mass–energy equivalence formula <b>E = mc2</b>, which arises
            from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
            equation" His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy
            of science. He received the 1921 <b>Nobel Prize</b> in Physics "for
            his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
            discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in
            the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and
            originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with
            "genius".
            <br />
            <br />
            In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle
            year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These
            outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian
            motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy
            equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics
            could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic
            field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He
            then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a
            paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of
            gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to
            model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal
            with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led
            to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules.
            He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum
            theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory
            of light.

            Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815
            – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly
            known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
            general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first
            to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
            calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to
            be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded
            as the first computer programmer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ada Byron was the only child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron.[5]
            All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other
            women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born
            and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the
            parting in a poem that begins, "Is thy face like thy mother's my
            fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?".[7] He died
            in Greece when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter
            and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to
            prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite
            this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and
            Gordon. Upon her eventual death, she was buried next to him at her
            request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her
            studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made
            Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.

            Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March
            2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author
            who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology
            at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death. He was the
            Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge
            between 1979 and 2009.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of doctors. He began his
            university education at University College, Oxford, in October 1959
            at the age of 17, where he received a first-class BA (Hons.) degree
            in physics. He began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge,
            in October 1962, where he obtained his PhD degree in applied
            mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general
            relativity and cosmology in March 1966. In 1963, Hawking was
            diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone
            disease that gradually paralysed him over the decades.[20][21] After
            the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating
            device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by
            using a single cheek muscle.
            <br /><br />
            Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger
            Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of
            general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes
            emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking
            radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the
            publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted
            as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was
            the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of
            the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a
            vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
            mechanics.

            Marie Salomea Skłodowska Curie (/ˈkjʊəri/ KEWR-ee;[3] French:

            [ˈmarja salɔˈmɛa skwɔˈdɔfska]; 7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934), was a
            Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted
            pioneering research on radioactivity. As the first of the Curie
            family legacy of five Nobel Prizes, she was the first woman to win a
            Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel
            Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two
            scientific fields. She was the first woman to become a professor at
            the University of Paris in 1906.
            <br />
            <br />
            She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part
            of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying
            University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In
            1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in
            Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her
            subsequent scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist
            Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with
            him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work
            developing the theory of "radioactivity"—a term she coined. In 1906
            Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911
            Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium
            and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive
            isotopes

            Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an
            English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author
            (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") who is widely
            recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and most
            influential scientists of all time. A key figure in the scientific
            revolution, his book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica
            (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in
            1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal
            contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician
            Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.
            <br>
            <br>
            In Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.

              Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor.[1][2][3] He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures.[4] These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory.
              <br>
              <br>
              Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions.[4] In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a botanic laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 of complications of diabetes.
